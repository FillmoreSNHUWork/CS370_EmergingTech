# CS370_EmergingTech
## Brief Explanation of the Work on the Project

### Given Code
- **Environment Setup**: A `TreasureMaze` class to create and manage the maze environment.
- **Basic Q-learning Framework**: A skeleton of the Q-learning training loop.

### Created Code
- **Neural Network Model**: Implemented using Keras.
- **Experience Replay**: Developed the `GameExperience` class to handle experience replay.
- **Training Loop Enhancements**: Updated the model based on experiences.
- **Hyperparameter Adjustments**: Managed exploration and exploitation strategies to improve the agent's performance.

* These modifications aimed to enhance the agent's efficiency in learning the optimal path to the treasure.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
* One of the biggest connections I can make from this course to our larger field is how important it is to scrutinize and question everything. The first thing that comes to mind is the integrity of the data we use to test our code, make decisions and feed models needs to be vetted and scrutinzed by a group of diverse indivuals. This is required to ensure data accurately represents target populations, that it is handled correctly and that the set is large enough to feed the model appropriately. This point leads to the ethical obligation we undertake as computer scientists, an obligation we discuss a lot in this course. This obligation leads us to ensure that projects we work on contre This topic is huge - covering things like appropriate use of technology (Facial recognition for example), appropriate disposal of data and bias in alogrithms.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve technical problems - through many different means. Sometimes this means through automation - coding a manual process, publishing code with a button press, testing code with CICD pipelines and through scripted jobs kicked off by intelligent agents. Other times this means vetting a new piece of technology - in my case it might be assessing a new Dell M-Series Server for potential enterprise use. I need to use the technology, test its components, run or server load and our builds to prove or disprove that the model might fit our organizations needs. It also means planning work for other engineers, designing a new application, class or method or mentoring less experienced engineers. I like to think the best of us blend technical expertise with soft-skills, giving us the ability to flex onto a multitude of project types and provide value.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I personally approach problems with reading and research. In our field - a lot of things have been done before. We can often find examples to inspire our work without starting from scratch, and its a common phrase that we don't need to "reinvent the wheel" all the time. That said - there are times when I need to go read documentation and source code to fully understand something and I won't shy away from that when the time comes.

That said - there are times where I am in uncharted territory and I need to read documentation to fully understand a class, method or implementation. I rely on other engineers inputs, experience and feedback on a daily basis to ensure my reasoning is sound and then I'm not making decisions in a vacuum. 

Trial and error and testing also play a huge part in how I solve problems. A lot of the time, I will stand up a local virtual machine or docker container, converge the application stack on my local machine and test and play with the stack to gain an understanding. 

To summarize - I approach problems dynamically, using all available resources to get the job done!

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are to protect my end-user and the organization with a security focused mindset. I will enforce our company data classification protections where needed and approach application design and build with a security mind-set. Depending on the data I'm working with, I need to be knowledgeable about the regulations associated with that data and apply the appropriate measures to protect that data.
